This describes the steps necessary to release Calabash to the Maven
Central repository.

Initial setup
=============

Make sure you have GPG installed, and have distributed a key to the
pool.sks-keyservers.net server

    gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys [your key ID]

Go to the Sonatype docs:

    https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

Carry out these steps:

    Section 2 - signing up for a Sonatype JIRA account
    Section 3 - creating a JIRA ticket

Download Ant Maven tasks from
http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/download.html and put it into
~/.ant/lib/.

Create an XML file at ~/.m2/settings.xml

    <settings>
      <servers>
        <server>
          <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
          <username>your-username</username>
          <password>your-password</password>
        </server>
        <server>
          <id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
          <username>your-username</username>
          <password>your-password</password>
        </server>
      </servers>
      <profiles>
      </profiles>
    </settings>

Releasing to Maven
==================

Run "ant maven-stage" to build a release and deploy it to the Sonatype server.

Go back to the Sonatype docs at

   https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide.
